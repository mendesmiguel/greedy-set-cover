# Set Cover Problem
The minimum set cover problem is considered a NP-Hard problem.
Given a universe U and S subsets of U. We call a cover C a collection of subsets from
S such that the union is U.
The goal of this project is to find a set of elements that cover all elements of with the minimum cost.
I am trying to tackle this problem using a GRASP metaheuristic with Local Search to find the covering sets.
